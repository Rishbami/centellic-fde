"""Synthetic transaction ledger. carried forward from Day 1.

SYNTHETIC PLACEHOLDER DATA ONLY. Every reference and amount used with this
module is invented for teaching purposes. No client data appears here.

Three decisions in this file are the point of the lesson:

1. A frozen dataclass instead of a bare dict.
   A dict of str to object tells mypy almost nothing, so mypy cannot help you.
   A dataclass gives every field a type, which turns the type checker from a
   formality into a reviewer that can actually catch a wrong field name.

2. Decimal instead of float for money.
   Binary floats cannot represent 10.10 exactly, so a float sum of
   10.10 + 20.20 + 5.05 returns 35.349999999999994, not 35.35. Decimal
   represents the value you typed and sums it exactly.

3. `entries: list[Entry] | None = None` instead of `entries: list = []`.
   A default argument is evaluated once, when the function is defined, so a
   mutable default is shared by every call. The None sentinel gives each call
   a fresh list.
